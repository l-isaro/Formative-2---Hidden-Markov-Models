## Project Overview
This project applies **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** to classify smartphone motion-sensor data into human activities.  
Each group member recorded accelerometer and gyroscope signals for **Jumping, Standing, Still, and Walking** using the **Sensor Logger** app.  

The dataset was preprocessed, feature-engineered in both time and frequency domains, and modeled with an HMM to infer hidden activity states from noisy sensor measurements.
